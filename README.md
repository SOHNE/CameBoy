## Introduction

`gbCEmu`‚Äîa raw dive into retro computing. This Game Boy‚Ñ¢ emulator, built in `C99`, isn‚Äôt about bells or whistles. It‚Äôs a hands-on experiment pieced together from a patchwork of online insights, designed to reveal the bare mechanics behind this classic handheld. Here, every line of code tries to be a lesson in minimalism, without unnecessary clutter.

> _**This project** serves as my experimental platform to delve into emulation's core principles. As a personal endeavor aimed at hands-on learning, it doesn't fully mirror the original hardware's intricacies. I welcome any contributions or suggestions. Feel free to explore the code, report issues, or submit pull requests._
